Core Purpose
A C++ application for managing student academic records using hash table data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of student data organized by academic programs.

System Architecture
Main Program → Menu System → Table Manager → Data Structures
                                  ↓
                           Hash Table with Linked List Chaining

Key Components
1. Menu System (menu.h/cpp)
User interface layer handling all I/O operations
Functions for adding, retrieving, editing, and removing students
File loading with data validation

2. Table Manager (table.h/cpp)
Core hash table implementation
Handles insert, retrieve, edit, and delete operations
Performance monitoring capabilities

3. Data Structures (student.h)
Student: Stores program, G-number, name, and academic standing
Node: Linked list nodes for collision resolution
Dynamic memory management with proper cleanup

Technical Implementation
Hash Table Design
Size: Default 10 buckets (configurable)
Hash Function: Simple ASCII sum modulo table size
Collision Resolution: Separate chaining with linked lists
Operations: O(1) average case for insert/retrieve/edit

Key Features
Academic standing tracking (1-5 scale: unacceptable to outstanding)
File-based data persistence (CSV format)
Performance monitoring (load factor, chain lengths)
Input validation and error handling

Data Flow
Startup: Auto-load from students.txt
Operations: Menu-driven user interactions
Storage: In-memory hash table with file backup
Memory: Dynamic allocation with RAII principles

Performance Characteristics
Fast Access: Hash table provides O(1) average operations
Efficient Storage: Dynamic allocation minimizes memory waste
Scalable: Handles multiple students per program via chaining

Design Strengths
Clear separation of concerns
Efficient data access patterns
Robust memory management
Modular, maintainable code structure

Potential Enhancements
Dynamic table resizing
Improved hash function
Additional search criteria
Binary file format for faster I/O

This design provides an efficient, maintainable solution for 
student data management with optimal performance for the core
operations of adding, retrieving, and updating student records.
