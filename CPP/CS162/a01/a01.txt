1. Initial Aprroach:
    I planned out the structures using the given templates. I then declared functions
    while defining them right afterwards. I then wrote the code after planning out the
    functions on a rough draft piece of paper. After writing it I ran and debugged it
    correcting errors.

2. Challenges & Problem-Solving:
    The most challenging section of the code was outlining what a function was to do
    on the rough draft before writing the actual code. I kept writing and rewriting
    loops and conditions to avoid endless loops and redundancy. Upon writing and
    rewriting, I ended up having a pseudocode. 

3. Testing and Debugging:
    I ran the code everytime I wrote a function to test the functionality of the code.
    I corrected the functions everytime step by step until I had written the whole code.

4. Design and Structure Improvements
    After completing the code I ran it a number of times correcting errors and improving
    functionality as well as calling functions where they are to be called. //Fixme
    statements were handy.

5. Conceptual Understanding
    My weakest topic was functions and loops and had to review them a number of times. I
    also had a slight problem in with arrays but got the hang of it real quick. Everything
    was review and it helped me know where to look most.
